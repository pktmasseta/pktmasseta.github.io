### FAQ

###### What is the deadline for applying for housing?

Applicants will be evaluated on a rolling basis, so it's in your best interest to apply sooner rather than later. If it's late in the year, you should still drop your application in case space is still available, as well as in case spots on our waitlist open up.

###### What happens after I apply?

We will accept applicants on a rolling basis. Accepted tenants will be sent a housing contract, as well as rooming, roommate, and social preference forms. Applicants must decide to commit to living at PKT within 5 days of receiving their acceptance. Any applicants on our wait list will be communicated separate details should you be accepted. You will only be required to pay for your room should you sign the contract, which commits our room to you, so itâ€™s up to you to officially decide!

Additionally, there is also a $600 security deposit which will be refunded at the end of the summer.

###### Can you tell me more about this cleaning service?

We are hiring a professional cleaning service to clean all shared areas of the house each week. Rest easy that PKT will be a clean and comfortable place to live in!

###### Is the PKT house wheelchair accessible?

Unfortunately, due to the architectural limitations of our house, it is not wheelchair accessible. We apologize for the inconvenience.

###### When is move in / move out day?

Accepted residents can move in any time after 5:00PM on Sunday June 1st, 2025 and must move out of the house by 5:00PM on Saturday August 16th, 2025.  If you must move in on a date other than June 1st, you must give a one week notice to the housing team. Alternative start and end dates can be negotiated on a case-by-case basis.

###### Is there shorter period summer housing?

Any tenant may check out at any time during summer, as long as it is before the move-out date! However, we currently do not offer reduced-rate partial summer housing.

###### Is parking available?

Yes! Parking will be offered for $400 for the whole summer, while availability lasts. This is first come first serve, so apply for parking fast!

###### How can I connect to the internet at PKT?

PKT has a really fast 802.11n guest WiFi network throughout the house. Additionally, all rooms have multiple Ethernet drops connected to MITnet. Our network is run by MIT; for more information on how to connect, please visit [this](https://ist.mit.edu/network/netguests) page.
