**The [application/interest form](https://forms.gle/mio1ocAamoW7wFPNA) for Summer 2025 housing is now open!**


If you're looking for housing in the Boston/Cambridge area for the summer of 2025, consider the PKT house for an unforgettable experience! Located right in the heart of Back Bay, our house provides easy access to all of the best parts of a warm summer in Boston: walks down the beautiful Charles River Esplanade, strolls through Boston Commons on the way to Chinatown, trips to Fenway to see the Red Sox, shopping at the luxurious Prudential Center, and evenings at dinner with your fellow residents on a Friday night. Our house's location makes all of these fun activities just a short walk away.

Of course, living in Boston isn't all about relaxing, touristy activities like those. You probably have an internship or a research job at one of Boston's many surrounding universities and companies and need to be able to get to work every morning. PKT has you covered! Our house is just a short walk away from the Copley T Station, connecting you to all of Boston. For MIT UROPs, the MIT Saferide stop is just a 10 minute walk away, or you can just enjoy a short walk or bike ride across Harvard Bridge to get to campus. 

Use this site to find more about our summer living situation and if our house sounds like the place for you, fill out our [Summer Housing interest form]([https://forms.gle/mio1ocAamoW7wFPNA]), or reach out to Samuel Zhou at pkt-summerhousing@mit.edu.
