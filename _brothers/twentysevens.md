    blurb: >
      Daeho Lee is one of PKT’s most loyal and kindest brothers. He’s always willing to be there for a brother, from going to the gym or to KBBQ to having a deep conversation for hours and being a comforting ear. By day, Daeho is a math genius who dreams of wasting his immense talents on quant. An integration bee participant and competition math aficionado, all he wants to do is take probability and cs courses and sell out to Jane street. However, one can guarantee that he will succeed at whatever he does, because that is the type of worker that Daeho is. He will keep doing math problems, keep calling his friends fat, keep making out with Emiliano, and keep being ignorant of his cuteness at PKT for 4 years and a lifetime beyond.

    nickname:
    blurb: >
      The quarter-Indian boogie man — the incarnation of John Wick. Few have lived to tell the tale of facing against The Rajagopal on the field, as he torpedoes his frisbee at mach Jesus obliterating ANY remaining hope of the opposing school. The aura is immense. But also his mathematical ability. Legend has it that he’s solved the three body problem in his head, while wearing his Celtics jersey playing 1v5 against the 2024 Olympic lineup. James. AD. Curry. KD. Kerr, even. None could surmount the edifice of The Rajagopal Titan. Not even together. Centuries later, religious texts and monuments will be erected to worship HIM. The. Isaac. Rajagopal.

    nickname:
    blurb: >
     Originally majoring in Climate Science, Alvin Chen soon fell for the allure of a world in the sheets – the Excel sheets. When he isn't benching 315, listening to K-pop, or preparing sashimi in his dorm room, Alvin dreams of increasing shareholder value. But don’t be fooled by his corporate ambitions; Mr. Chen is a loverboy at heart. With a broken ankle as his constant companion, Alvin is now a scooter-bound speed demon, zipping across campus at lightning speed. His ankle might be in pieces, but his determination to make the most of every situation is unbreakable.

    nickname: NickyNix
    blurb: >
      Josh Nix is not your typical finance bro—he's a spreadsheet junkie and rising star at Global Platinum Securities (GPS). The only lines Josh has his nose on are the upward trend lines in his portfolio. When he's not crunching numbers, he's leading MIT's DEAL FPOP and advocating for rural students as an MIT Admissions ambassador. Josh's next move? Flexing his math, language, and poli-sci skills as a research assistant at Harvard Law. But it's not all business—catch him at Life Alive with his signature acai bowl or hanging at PRB, bringing that Oklahoma charm to every scene.

Hailing from Coachella, California, this man is the undisputed GOAT of maximizing shareholder value (and dopamine), whether he’s placing 17 way parlays, bluffing his way to billions of poker chips, or speedrunning his ascent to becoming a corporate overlord in SBC. It’s said that those graced by Emiliano’s touch are blessed with superhuman abilities in whatever they choose; fortunately for the other PKTs, you will always catch this man rubbing other brothers at random times for seemingly no reason. If you catch him in his natural habitat, you may find him on his way to hit a 5 plate bench, a 5 plate almuerzo, or cooking everyone in the basketball courts in the Z. With all that being said, behind the superhuman legend that is Emiliano Camacho Almanza is a really funny and chill guy who’s a blast to hang out with.

    nickname: Mateo Chen
    blurb: >
      Wallah, it’s Matthew Chen. Hailing from the charming town of Maple Grove, MN, Matthew aka “Mateo” Chen is a proud Vikings and Timberwolves fan, despite the heartache they often bring him. With hair that defies gravity, a result of years spent religiously gelling it up, and his signature puffy dark black North Face jacket, Matthew is hard to miss. He’s a die-hard Tim Walz fanboy and a sports enthusiast, with a particular love for football. Matthew's academic prowess is something to behold—he's an AI math guy, constantly delving into the complexities of algorithms and equations. Despite his intellect, he's incredibly down-to-earth, with no hint of arrogance. While he’s not nerding out on AI, you can find him at the poker table, dominating. Matthew is also on a quest for true love, navigating the tricky waters of girl troubles with determination. Though he's a Chinese dude, he often makes a big deal about his Korean heritage, adding to his unique charm. Standing tall at 6' and just 19 years old, he’s a an eligible bachelor, a powerful force to be dealt with. Just stop hanging out in Canyon all the time. Last summer, Matthew had a stint at Raytheon. While the details are a bit hush-hush, let's just say the AI bombs he worked on are better left undiscussed. As the IM chair, he showed great organizational skills, though his passion for the role was admittedly a bit lacking. He’s often heard discussing his grand plans for the future for his Chen Dynasty—dreaming of a startup, a DINKY family, and enjoying the high life."

    quote:
    nickname: 
    blurb: >
      The party never begins without the infamous Yaphetti. One of the most handsome brothers, you’ll never see him without a fresh cut. With lines as sharp as his mechanical tools, a taper smoothed into an artistic gradient and a goatee as majestic as him, one cannot help but fall for him.  Like many before him, he is yet another peer falling victim to the choice between Course 2 and Course 6. Would he sell out to SWE or ML, or take the high road and follow his passions? An avid robotics enthusiast, he often reminisces about his days in FIRST Robotics. A false veteran with stolen valor, he speaks about his leadership position. But determined to turn this around, you can see him roaming Building 3 with CAD open on his computer as he makes his way to his robotics UROP. A true light of the party. You could feel his nonchalant energy as he displays the “exaggerated swagger of a Black teen (IGN).” One of the most passionate brothers, Yaphet will never steer away from a late night grind. When one searches “locked in” in the dictionary, you will see a picture of the handsome Yaphet. Whether locked in means being stowed away in the Maseeh Halls or being glued to his computer science work, he is one of the most hard working brothers. A future business owner, a future Mars Rover designer, a future biomedical robotics pioneer, Yaphet can do it all.

    blurb: >
      If you catch a whiff of something delicious or spot a guy with a guitar in one hand and a dumbbell in the other, it’s probably Guillermo Mendoza Contreras. Hailing from the Bay Area, Guillermo is the class of '27's favorite class of ‘26 transfer student and a community college success story. His dreams include being rejected from UC Davis for a third time and selling out in the most glamorous way possible. Whether he's in the kitchen or out on the dance floor, Guillermo is always cooking. Just don't ask him what he does for fun—he's still trying to figure out if "working" or "LeetCode" qualifies. And if you need a hiking buddy or someone to go to the redwoods with, he’s your guy.

    nickname:

      There will never again be a man quite like Cole. There is but one person who dyed his hair purple and then went on to max out the athletic evaluation in ROTC in the same month; one person who can send a V9 in the rock-climbing gym and tear up a saxophone solo for the wind ensemble; one person who can lead a team in a push-up competition and coordinate a sexy dance number. That man is Cole Wickert. If you have the pleasure of getting to know Cole, you’ll eventually learn not to be intimidated by his intense discipline and resolute stoicism, because at his core, you’ll find him to be one of the goofiest and sweetest brothers and friends you’ll ever meet.

    nickname: Iron Man
    blurb: >
      Standing tall at 6’4” and built like a titan, Ethan is the man every woman dreams of and every guy wishes he be. He's not just an engineering prodigy; he's the very embodiment of creativity. Practically living in the Vassar makerspace, this caffeine-fueled mastermind has hands that work magic with the brain of Iron Man. When he’s not building mind-blowing drones or epic displays for the house, you’ll find him having the kind of deep, soul-stirring conversations that leave you questioning the very fabric of existence. A builder by day and a philosopher by night, Ethan doesn’t just face challenges; he dominates them, whether it’s tackling a notoriously tough physics class or diving headfirst into the startup world. A relentless workaholic, he’s always on the move—literally—zipping by on his electric longboard. Keep your eyes peeled because this guy’s inventions are bound to change the world.

    quote:
    nickname:
    blurb: >
      Hailing from Detroit, JIJ is one of the kindest, most genuine people we have ever met. His love for his fellow brothers is only exceeded by his massive 225-pound bench press. Whenever he’s not casually moving a few plates at the gym or saving burning orphanages, you can find him out-contemplating Socrates or out-solving Pythagoras. But be warned, JIJ is known to ask some pretty outlandish questions or nag you while you drive (shoutout Guillermo). All jokes aside, JIJ is the perfect combination of brain, brawn, and heart, and we are so lucky to have him around.

    blurb: >
      Hey guys, I'm Sam from Seattle, Washington. I plan on majoring in computer science and finance, but enjoy taking math and business classes as well. I'm on the MIT basketball team, so I devote a couple of hours everyday playing basketball. Probably the only thing I love as much basketball is eating. Other than that, you will probably find me seeking job offers all the time. I'm glad to have joined PKT and I'm excited for the next few years!
