      Hailing the wild midsts of Addis Ababa, Kedus “Leji” Yared is a man of many talents - when he’s not managing his magnificent ‘fro or curating the afrobeats on his spotify playlist, he’s shooting hoops on the court (he doesn’t miss a layup). Part of the Ethiopian (royal) famline, lil’kedus(y) salutes his big - big’kedus(y). One of the kindest brothers, his mesmering eyes will pierce through your soul - Lil’Kedus(y) is a force to be reckoned with.

    name: Bobby Costin

    major: CS + Engineering (6-3)
    hometown: Bucharest, Romania

    nickname: Blobby
    blurb: >
      There aren’t many activities that Bobby would say no to. One of PKT’s most committed brothers (and treasurers), he rallies for every event and is always there to brighten the mood. 3AM on a weekday? No problem for Bobby—just chug another Celsius (and remain their number one customer on campus). When he isn’t cuddling with his roommate Baxter, Bobby is likely deep in his algorithms. A USACO finalist and instructor, Bobby can hack through any problem in the world. But don’t consider him your typical CS major—Bobby is also a beast in the gym and boasts an impressive YouTube portfolio from his peak years at home.

    activities: Biotech group, Neuroscience (Optogenetics / Brain Control) Urop
    major: 6-5 and 9
    hometown: Bay Area, CA
    quote:
    nickname: Big Beautiful Boy
    blurb: > 
      Baxter the “Big Beautiful Boy” is one of those people you can’t quite believe is real. He’s the tall guy from the Bay Area who somehow manages to be the smartest in the room, the funniest in the room, and the best looking in the room all at once. He studies 6-5 and 9, splitting his time between building the future of biotech and literally controlling brains with optogenetics, but what makes him stand out even more is the way he does it without ever losing his genuine kindness. Everyone knows Baxter will drop whatever he’s doing to help, no matter how busy he is. He runs on energy drinks and sheer willpower, pulling off marathon stretches of work with almost no sleep, yet still shows up ready to make people laugh. Around PKT, he’s the guy everyone looks up to, whether it’s for his brilliance, his loyalty, or just the way he carries himself. Baxter is more than a brother, he’s the kind of person who turns respect into admiration and admiration into legend.

    name: Brandon Lin
    activities: UROP, IM Basketball, StartLabs, Lifting
    major: 2A-20
    hometown: Baton Rouge, LA
    quote:
    nickname: Jeremy (B)lin
    blurb: >
      Brandon “lifeofblin” Lin was born in 2005, the year of our Lord. We have no idea the origin of his birthplace, but it’s probably somewhere in the southern depths of Louisiana. Not much is known about his early years. All we know is that he grew up with a clear sense of purpose…that purpose, fueled by a sense of hunger and an unwavering desire to conquer. Well, what was he in conquest for? Triumph. Triumph in devouring the sweet essence of life and all it has to offer. He displayed this triumph in the classroom, in the gym, and most notably of all, on the basketball courts of the MIT Zesiger Center. With every flicked wrist and every swish, his opponents wept bitter tears of despair. For when Sir Brandon takes the court, he does not merely play—he wages war. And until the fabled day he carried home his trophy, he labored without respite, tempered by sweat, iron, and an unshakable belief in his destiny. Yet even the mightiest knight requires a guiding star. For Brandon, such a lodestar appears in the form of his great and noble big, Sam Chen. From Sam, Brandon draws wisdom and strength, as a squire from his lord. Together, they form a bond unbroken, a tale of kinship that shall echo through the ages. Thus, let it be known: Brandon Lin, eater of meals, lifter of iron, conqueror of courts, and loyal brother, shall stride boldly into the annals of legend. And though the years may pass and his feats turn to myth, one truth shall remain undoubted: wherever hunger, strength, and victory intertwine, there too shall be found the life of blin.

    major: 6-3
    hometown: Tampa, FL
    quote:
    nickname: Bhangra Final Boss
    blurb: >
      Vinny is the kind of PKT brother who will light up any room, whether it’s from his crowd-roaring bhangra moves, his laser-focused wit at the poker table, or his infectious laugh that somehow makes you forget you lost 28 bucks to his Royal Flush hand. A true Tampa native, Vinny thrives on creativity and community, dreaming up projects in HackMIT that actually help people. How he can keep carrying himself with immense charisma and wit? We don’t know. But legends say he ascended on the top of Peru’s Machu Picchu during his world travels, and that’s where he got it from. The man is pure good vibes, and he is the brother you can count on to bring a whole lot of heart.
